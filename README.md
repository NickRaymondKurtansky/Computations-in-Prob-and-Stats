BigData_Kurtansky_Nick_STT461_project_20180426.Rmd: Simulating of a Sure Independent Sampling on a "big data" set.
  In Part 1, I produced data sets whose true response signal to varibles are known, and then calculated the MMS, which is the median number of variables needed in the model in order to identify all true signals.
  In Part 2, I identify the top 10 variables contributing to a string of cancer from a big data set using SIS.
